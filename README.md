## How It Works

- The app uses two dictionaries to map between characters and Morse code.
- It plays a different sound for `.` (dot) and `-` (dash).
- It uses `AVFoundation` for audio playback.
- Sounds are played **in sync with each Morse symbol** using timed delays.
- The translated Morse code is shown after all sounds are played.

   - `dashSound.wav` (long beep for `-`)
4. Press **Run** to test the translator!
